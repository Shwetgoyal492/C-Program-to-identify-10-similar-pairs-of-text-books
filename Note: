Dear Professor,

I would like to bring to your attention that I was unable to implement multithreading in this project due to technical limitations on my personal computer. Despite multiple attempts, the multithreaded implementation was causing unexpected behavior and system instability due to unknown hardware/software compatibility issues. Therefore, I proceeded with a single-threaded implementation to ensure reliable and correct functionality of the program.

And also all of my output are in a zip file named project_masai. Please consider the same.

Thankyou for your co-operation.
